# ðŸ§  Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis with PyTorch

This repository contains a series of independent deep learning projects focused on analyzing real-world medical images using PyTorch. The tasks include:

- âœ… **Pneumonia Classification** from chest X-ray images  
- âœ… **Cardiac Structure Detection** in DICOM format  
- âœ… **Tumor Segmentation** in lung and liver scans

Each project demonstrates a complete pipeline from data loading and preprocessing (including DICOM handling), to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- DICOM image processing with `pydicom` and `OpenCV`
- Classification, Object Detection, and Semantic Segmentation
- PyTorch deep learning framework
